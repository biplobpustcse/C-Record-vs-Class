# C-Record-vs-Class
In C#, both record and class are reference types, but they have different purposes and behaviors. Here's a comparison between the two:

1. Purpose and Use Cases
Class: Traditionally used for defining objects with methods, properties, and fields. Classes are often used when the identity of an object is more important than the data it holds.
Record: Primarily used for defining immutable data structures where value-based equality is more important than identity. Records are often used for data transfer objects (DTOs) or other scenarios where immutability and value equality are desirable.
2. Immutability
Class: Classes are mutable by default, meaning their properties can be modified after the object is created. You can make them immutable by using readonly fields and properties with private setters.
Record: Records are immutable by default when you use init instead of set for properties. This means you can only set their values during object initialization, not afterward.
```
// Class example
public class PersonClass
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

// Record example
public record PersonRecord(string FirstName, string LastName);
```
3. Equality
Class: By default, classes use reference equality, meaning two objects are considered equal only if they reference the same object in memory.
Record: Records use value-based equality by default, meaning two records are considered equal if all their properties have the same values.
```
var class1 = new PersonClass { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe" };
var class2 = new PersonClass { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe" };
bool areClassesEqual = class1 == class2;  // false, because of reference equality

var record1 = new PersonRecord("John", "Doe");
var record2 = new PersonRecord("John", "Doe");
bool areRecordsEqual = record1 == record2;  // true, because of value equality
```
4. Inheritance
Class: Classes support inheritance, meaning you can create derived classes that extend the functionality of a base class.
Record: Records also support inheritance, but the base and derived records will still use value-based equality. The equality check includes the base record's properties as well.
5. Deconstruction
Class: Classes do not support deconstruction out of the box, but you can manually implement it.
Record: Records support deconstruction by default, allowing you to easily extract values from the record into separate variables.
```
var (firstName, lastName) = record1;
```
6. With-Expressions
Class: Classes do not support with expressions. To create a new object with some modified properties, you would typically create a copy constructor or a method.
Record: Records support with expressions, making it easy to create a new record with some properties modified.
```
var record3 = record1 with { FirstName = "Jane" };
```
7. Performance Considerations
Class: Since classes use reference equality by default, they may perform better in scenarios where many objects are compared, and only reference equality is required.
Record: The value-based equality in records can involve comparing all properties, which might have a slight performance overhead compared to reference equality, especially with large data structures.
Summary
Use class when you need mutable objects, complex behavior, or when identity is crucial.
Use record when you need immutable data, value-based equality, and concise syntax for data objects.
Both record and class have their place in C# development, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of your application.
